# responsive-portfolio

This is homework assignment #2: Responsive Portfolio. In this assignment, we, the students of Fullstack Web Development, were tasked to create a responsive website using bootstrap. There were 3 main breaking points assigned and referenced in the assets folder that we had to follow: 980px (desktop), 768px (tablet), and 640px (mobile). The task assigned was to follow the reference pictures in the assets folder and do our best to re-create or make something similar to the designs assigned.
 
 ## Getting Started

* Create the following files files: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.

* Using Bootstrap, develop your portfolio site with the following items:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images

* The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.

* Screenshots are provided as a reference in the `Assets/Images` folder. Your app does not need to be _exactly_ like the images. Use Bootstrap to create a similar, responsive layout.

### Prerequisites

* Functional, deployed application

* GitHub repository with README describing the project

* Navbar must be consistent on each page.

* Navbar on each page must contain links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.

* All links must work.

* Must use semantic html.

* Each page must have valid and correct HTML. (use a validation service)

* Must contain your personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)

* Must properly utilize Bootstrap components and grid system.


## Running the project

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down
  ## Copy & Paste + Changes
I wanted to focus on making sure that the header, navigation and footer were all universal in each page and respond the same. To ensure that, I foused on working on the index.html page first then copy and pasted those tags into the rest of the contact.html & portfolio.html pages. I changed the active navs to ensure that it is accurate and to let the user know which page they are on. I also changed the <h2> tags to ensure the title of those pages are accurate as well. 
  
```html
<h2>About Me</h2> <h2>Portfolio</h2> <h2>Contact</h2>
```
